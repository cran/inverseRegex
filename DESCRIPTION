Description: Reverse engineer a regular expression pattern for the characters
    contained in an R object. Individual characters can be categorised into
    digits, letters, punctuation or spaces and encoded into run-lengths. This
    can be used to summarise the structure of a dataset or identify non-standard
    entries. Many non-character inputs such as numeric vectors and data frames
    are supported.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
